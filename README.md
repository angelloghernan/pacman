# pacman
A faithful HTML5 recreation of Pacman I did as a freshman using Phaser. Can be run using any basic html server and loading the default index.html page.

Contains a couple of bugs -- I haven't tested it since 2020. For example, in Chromium, the "High Score"/"Player One" text appears in the wrong place, when this was not the case in 2020. It works correctly using Safari, however.
